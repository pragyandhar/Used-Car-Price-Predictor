# 🚗 Used Car Price Predictor

A Machine Learning project that predicts the **selling price of a used car** based on various features like year of purchase, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and more.

Built using **Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn**, and a beautiful GUI created with **Streamlit**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

With the rise of the used car market, estimating the right resale value of a car can be tricky. This project helps individuals and dealers predict used car prices using machine learning — making pricing **smarter, faster, and data-driven**.

---

## 📊 Tech Stack Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data preprocessing & analysis
- **Scikit-learn** – training the Linear Regression model
- **Pickle** – saving the trained model
- **Streamlit** – creating a user-friendly web interface
